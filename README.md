# NOTICE
Every project in the repo is based on the ESP32-D0WD-V3 (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08D5ZD528). <br> Results may vary with different models.

I will not be accepting pull requests, as this repo is only made public to provide example programs to those who also want to learn as I did.

# Learning ESP
This is a repo of small programs I've made to help myself learn the ESP32. Every folder should contain program files, a list of references, and a description of the program. Some programs may require some editing before they work properly (ex: entering a MAC address).

# Editing and Uploading
The <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/">Arduino IDE</a> was used to write and upload these programs (unless stated otherwise in the program description). It is reccomended to do the same if you want to upload any of these programs to your own ESP32.
